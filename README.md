# NBA-Championship-Odds-Prediction
As a longtime NBA fan, I was inspired to take up this project after seeing the endless debates on social media about which team would win the championship. Thus, I decided to build a Machine Learning model to predict the odds of a team winning the NBA Championship.

This model uses readily available data in the form of player info + team performance to determine the probability of a team becoming NBA Champion.
